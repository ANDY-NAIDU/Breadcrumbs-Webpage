# Breadcrumbs-Webpage

I had created this non-attractive but very functional website with the help of **NodeJs + Express**<br>
<br>
this is an idea that had been revolving around my head from a pretty long time since I somehow gained the idea
<br>
<br>
this project may not be helpful to the most of the people out there but there can be someone who can utlise the juice in this project<br>
# Project Explanation

in this i got an idea from some website that i am surfing through and where i can see these Breadcrumbs everywhere and navigating me through the whole website and I find that idea interesting and noticed that i was pretty simple to build that folder-ish format with the help of JSON file mechanism.

This is my first time getting associated with the file management and data extraction and updation. So, its pretty helpful for me to upgrade my knowlege and extend it.
